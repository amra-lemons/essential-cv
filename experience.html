        <hr>
        <p>While I was in the last semester of my Master's Degree program at Osaka University, I joined the marketing department at Information Security Inc., an IT company specialized in cyber-security in Kobe, as an intern. There I was in charge of content marketing, PR, the company'swebsite and social media. Next I briefly worked at a second hand goods company where I was in charge of digital marketing / web design. Currently I work at an export company where I am in charge of managing the company's websites and digital marketing among other responsabilites.</p>
